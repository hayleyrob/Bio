I'm from the SF Bay Area and went to UCLA for undergrad where I studied Fine Art and Anthropology.
I discovered my interest in tech during my first job as a CSM at a Web Dev company. 
That prompted me to move to San Francisco and started career in Sales at a tech startup.
Most recently, I was an Account Executive at a public tech company, but found my real interest was in creating software, not selling it.
This prompted me to take some time off and travel, subsequently deciding to enroll at UC Irvine and pursue the career I always wanted as a Product Manager.
