  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2 style="color:blue">Career</h2>
    <p>
    I discovered my interest in tech during my first job as a CSM at a Web Dev company. 
    This prompted me to move to SF and started career in sales at a tech startup. <br>
    Most recently, I was an Account Executive at a public tech company in New York, 
    but found my real interest was increating software, not selling it. <br>
    Subsequently deciding to enroll at UC Irvine and pursue the career I
    always wanted as a Product Manager.
